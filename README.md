TODO : update ENV For backend FRONT_END_URL

---
###Installation Instructions

  To use this project locally

```
$ git clone https://github.com/GoldenLuckyDragon/Cherri.git
```
Then change into the directory  
```
$ cd Cherri
```
The project is in front and backend lets set up the backend first

you will need a stripe account goto https://dashboard.stripe.com/register
register for an account and in the dashboard sign up for connect.

Stripe connect allows the platform to be a middleman between a transaction of two clients.

Once you have a stripe account register your platform here
https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/applications/settings

now run

```
$ cd backend && touch .env
```
this will move you to the backend folder and create a dotenv file we can save our environment variables inside.

copy and paste the following inside
```
STRIPE_DEV_SECRET=
CLIENT_ID=

```
fill in your Client ID from your stripe dashboard under settings.

Keep the dashboard open as you will need it again.

 update your modules with
```
$ yarn install
```
Stripe requires a handshake verification process which must be done over https and cannot be done on localhost.



Download and install ngrok from
https://ngrok.com/download

This will allow us to overcome this
 cd to the download directory

```
  cd [PATH TO NGROK probably /downloads]
```
and run
```
 $ ngrok http 8080
```

this creates a secure public connection to your localhost

![ngrok](/backend/public/ngrok.png)

copy the https url and go back to your dashboard
and it as a new redirect_URI

on the bottom left of the dashboard make sure you select test data

![test_data](backend/public/test_data.png)

Goto your dashboard

add your redirect_uri and make sure to add

```
/users/auth/stripe_connect
```
to the end of your ngrok https url.

it might look something like this
```
https://2221ajecb.ngrok.io/users/auth/stripe_connect

```


now goto click on API on the left of the dashboard and save both your stripe secret key to your new .env file


Dashboard should look like this
![redirect](backend/public/redirect.png)

Keep a terminal open inside /backend
and run
```
$ yarn start
```
 you should see
 ```
 Server running on port: 8080
 Successful connection to MongoDB
 ```




If you do not already have MongoDb, you will need to install it with the following steps.

---
### MongoDb

open a new Terminal window with <kbd>CMD</kbd> + <kbd>T</kbd>

We use MongoDb, with this project you can install it using homebrew.

You can find the MongoDb docs [here](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-os-x/)

First update your homebrew with

```
$ brew update
```

then run
```
$ brew install mongodb
```
once the installation is complete run

```
$ mongod --dbpath /usr/local/var/mongodb
```

a Successful connection will display
```
waiting for connections on port 27017
```


---



#### Setting Up The Front End

In a new terminal window (keep the other windows open)
 <kbd>CMD</kbd>  + <kbd>T</kbd>

now type
```
$ cd ..
```
to go back a folder and then
```
$ cd frontend
```
to move to the front end folder.

make a new .env file with

```
$ touch .env
```

copy the following inside

```
REACT_APP_STRIPE_DEV_PUBLISH=
REACT_APP_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:8080
```
Fill in the STRIPE_DEV_PUBLISH with your test publishable key from your stripe dashboard.

now run
```
$ yarn install
```

You should have 3 terminal windows in total

*1.* Cherri/backend running.

*2.* mongodb running.

*3.* cherri/frontend


and then
```
$ yarn start
```
to start the website.

  Controversally it removes semicolons but we figure this to be they way of the future anyway.
  Because of this, you can never start a line with (, [, or `
